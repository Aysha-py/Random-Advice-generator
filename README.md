Hi, thanks for checking out my repository.

This is a random-Advice-generator from [www.frontendmentor.io.](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db)

I replicated this project to practice Working with APIs and using the boostrap framework. 
This project was completed with Html, css, Boostrap and Vanilla javascript only.

## Features of the project.

User can generate a new random advice everytime they click on the button in the projec.
Mobile-responsive.

## My process 
1. Html
2. Boostrap
3. Javascript
4. Javascript promise and chainning

## What I learned 

1. I learnt the mobile first approach that bootsrap used which allowed me to design for mobile screens 
first before specifying breakpoints related to bigger screens

2. I learnt how to use the javascript `fetch` inbuilt funnction, and getting the contents of the API using `.then` after the fetch promise has been fulfilled.
