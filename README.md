Hi, thanks for checking out my repository.

This is a random advice generator from [www.frontendmentor.io.](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db)

I replicated this project in practice Working with APIs and using the bootstrap framework. 
This project was only completed with Html, CSS, Bootstrap, and Vanilla javascript.

## Features of the project.

The user can generate new random advice every time they click on the button in the project.
Mobile-responsive.

## My process 
1. Html
2. Bootstrap
3. Javascript
4. Javascript promises and chaining

## What I learned 

1. I learned the mobile-first approach that Bootstrap used, which allowed me to design for mobile screens 
first before specifying breakpoints related to more larger screens

2. I learned how to use the javascript `fetch` inbuilt function to get the contents of the API using `.then` after the fetch promise has been fulfilled.
